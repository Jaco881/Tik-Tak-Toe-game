Hello

This is a small project i made after 2 months of experience learning Java.
It's a TikTakToe classic game 3x3 grid, i made 3 versions:
1-Computer vs Computer
2-Player vs Computer
3-Player vs Player
Actually i uploaded the second version PvC.
The index file contain the main code where the value for player X or O is saved inside 
the array.
The bot player every time it's his turn will check all the patterns inside the others external funcions, 
so the bot will chose what is the best avable slot to use.
